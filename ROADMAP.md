## 📝 Notes

- **Parallel Execution**: Currently simulated. Need to implement true concurrent API calls using Promise.all()
- **Tools**: Can leverage OpenAI's function calling or implement custom tool framework
- **Conversation**: Need to maintain message history in state and include in API calls
- **System Prompts**: Should be configurable per agent and per orchestration pattern
- **Save/Load**: Use Supabase for persistence, with user-scoped data

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- User retention: 40% DAU/MAU
- Average session length: >10 minutes
- Saved orchestrations per user: >5
- API usage per user: >100 calls/month
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5 stars
