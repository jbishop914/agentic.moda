# 🚀 Supabase Setup Instructions

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Authentication System**
- Email/password signup and signin
- Magic link authentication
- User profiles with RLS (Row Level Security)
- Session management

### 2. **Database Tables**
- `profiles` - User profiles
- `saved_prompts` - Store prompts with configurations
- `saved_outputs` - Store execution outputs
- `orchestrations` - Save complete workflows
- `conversations` - Persist conversation threads
- `execution_history` - Track all executions

### 3. **True Parallel Execution**
- Actually runs multiple OpenAI calls simultaneously using `Promise.all()`
- Each agent gets a slightly different temperature for diversity
- Results are synthesized into a final output
- Real performance improvement (not simulated!)

### 4. **API Endpoints**
- `/api/prompts` - Save/load prompts
- `/api/outputs` - Save/load outputs
- `/api/orchestrate` - Enhanced with true parallel execution

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install @supabase/ssr --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. **Run Database Schema**

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fqahqwodkunntpsgwqon
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
5. Click **Run** to create all tables and policies

### 3. **Configure Authentication**

In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Providers**
2. Enable **Email** provider (should be on by default)
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Email Templates**
4. Customize the confirmation email if desired

### 4. **Enable Email Confirmations (Optional)**

For development, you might want to disable email confirmations:
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Email**
2. Toggle off "Confirm email" for easier testing

### 5. **Update Your App**

The app now has:
- **Sign In button** in the header
- **Save buttons** for prompts and outputs (💾 and ⬇️ icons)
- **Conversation mode** with persistent history
- **True parallel execution** when using Parallel pattern

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Parallel Execution**
When you select "Parallel Execution" and set agents to 3:
1. Creates 3 separate API calls to OpenAI
2. Each agent gets a slightly different temperature (0.7, 0.8, 0.9)
3. All execute simultaneously (true parallelism!)
4. Results are synthesized by a 4th agent
5. Total time is roughly the same as 1 agent, not 3x!

### **Feedback Loop**
1. Worker agent creates initial content
2. Judge agent reviews and provides feedback
3. If not approved, worker improves based on feedback
4. Continues for up to 3 iterations
5. Final approved version is returned

### **Saving Data**
When logged in:
- Click 💾 to save a prompt
- Click ⬇️ to save an output
- All saves are user-scoped (only you can see your data)
- Execution history is automatically tracked

## 🔍 Test the Features

1. **Create an Account**:
   - Click "Sign In"
   - Switch to "Sign Up"
   - Enter email and password
   - Check email for confirmation (or skip if disabled)

2. **Test Parallel Execution**:
   - Select "Parallel Execution"
   - Set agents to 3-5
   - Enter prompt: "What are the top 3 innovations in AI?"
   - Watch all agents work simultaneously!

3. **Test Feedback Loop**:
   - Select "Iterative Refinement"
   - Enter prompt: "Write a haiku about coding"
   - Watch the judge provide feedback and improvements

4. **Test Conversation Mode**:
   - Check "Conversation" checkbox
   - Send a message
   - Continue the conversation with context

## 📊 Database Access

To view your data:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **Table Editor** in sidebar
3. Browse tables:
   - `profiles` - Your user profile
   - `saved_prompts` - Your saved prompts
   - `saved_outputs` - Your saved outputs
   - `execution_history` - All your executions

## 🎨 What's Next?

The foundation is complete! You can now:
- Sign up/in with email
- Save and load prompts/outputs
- Run true parallel agents
- Have persistent conversations
- Track execution history

Want to add:
- Google/GitHub OAuth?
- Saved items library view?
- Export functionality?
- Team workspaces?
- Usage analytics dashboard?

The infrastructure is all set - just need to build the UI views! 🚀
