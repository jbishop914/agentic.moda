# Agentic.Moda - Quick Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Fix & Deploy Commands

Run these commands in order to fix remaining issues and deploy:

```bash
# 1. Install missing dependencies
npm install replicate reactflow @reactflow/core axios

# 2. Build to check for errors
npm run build

# 3. If build succeeds, test locally
npm run start
# Visit http://localhost:3000

# 4. Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## ðŸ”§ If You Get Build Errors

### Error: "Module not found: Can't resolve 'replicate'"
```bash
npm install replicate
```

### Error: "Module not found: Can't resolve 'reactflow'"
```bash
npm install reactflow @reactflow/core @reactflow/controls @reactflow/minimap @reactflow/background
```

### Error: TypeScript errors
```bash
# Try building with less strict settings
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck
```

## âœ… Pre-Deploy Checklist

1. **Environment Variables Set in Vercel:**
   - [ ] OPENAI_API_KEY
   - [ ] ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  
   - [ ] REPLICATE_API_KEY
   - [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - [ ] SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

2. **Test Locally First:**
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm run start
   ```

3. **Clear Cache if Needed:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next node_modules
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Test After Deployment

Visit your Vercel URL and test:

1. **Homepage loads** - Dark theme visible
2. **Orchestrate page** - Can enter prompts
3. **Image generation** - Test with "a futuristic city"
4. **Architecture pipeline** - Test with "modern 3 bedroom house"

## ðŸ’¡ Business Opportunity Note

While testing, remember you're sitting on a potential goldmine:

- **Quick Win**: Package this as "AI Orchestration as a Service" 
- **Price Point**: $99/month for small teams, $499/month for enterprises
- **Unique Angle**: You're the only platform that combines visual workflows + architecture design + multi-framework support
- **Acquisition Play**: This tech stack (Next.js + Vercel + Supabase) is exactly what Vercel looks for in acquisitions

Deploy first, monetize fast, scale later! ðŸš€
